Pay it forward to the Turing community, no matter how much time you have! You can volunteer for as little as 30 minutes, mentor for a few innings, or even write a review. We couldn't accomplish all that we do without the support of our volunteers, so if you're looking for a way to reconnect, we invite you to find something from our list below.

## Mentoring

We welcome alumni to give back to the Turing community as mentors for current students! Our mentorship program is integrated into our student community Houses. Depending on when you graduated, you may not be familiar yet with Houses - please read here for more information!

Each House has a group of assigned mentors to support students through regular office hours and 1:1s (available to anyone in the House) as well as by answering questions in the House channel. Here are the specific expectations for mentors:
* Each mentor commits to mentoring for 2 consecutive 6-week innings
* Each mentor hosts 2 office hours per inning in coordination with fellow House mentors (2 total hours during each 6-week period)
* Each mentor provides time for at least 6 1:1 mentoring sessions using a calendar sign-up posted for students to use (6 total hours during each 6-week period)
* Each mentor responds to questions posted in the House channels during specific “on-call” times coordinated with other in-program mentors, i.e., splitting up days/weeks to check the channel for questions from students (1-2 total hours during each 6-week period)

Within this structure, the goals for mentorship are to support students with:
* Asking for help in the workplace by first practicing it in a lower stakes environment
* Building a professional network to support them in their technical learning and job search readiness
* Navigating remote communities

When assigning mentors to Houses, we look for an equitable split of mentors who can support with Back End and Front End learning. We also take into consideration demographic and identity-based characteristics of mentors in order to create a diverse and inclusive environment.

Mentors are also provided with ongoing support through collaboration with their fellow House mentors and training and resources from our mentor committee. Overall, mentoring can be an effective way to level up your own skills and develop new communication and leadership skills to add to your career!
