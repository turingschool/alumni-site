## Hiring Turing Grads

Turing's Partnership Manager can be reached via email for all questions related to hiring.

### Posting Jobs

There are two ways to share a job at Turing:
1. Post directly to #job-hunt on Turing's Slack **OR**
2. [Post your jobs on Terminal](https://terminal.turing.edu/add-job) - the Turing Community's internal job board for junior, mid, and senior level jobs. In addition to the job board listing, jobs are posted on Turing’s Slack and are sent out via email.
a. Create a company profile (you only have to do this once).
b. Provide your contact information. Only Turing’s Partnership Manager and staff will have access to this info for follow-up questions.
c. Share details about the job, including a link to apply on your website or to receive more info.

Additional ways to connect with entry level devs:
* [Browse our new grads](https://terminal.turing.edu/profiles) (all are looking for jobs). Reach out directly or contact our Partnership Manager for an intro.
* Contact our Partnership Manager to create a curated list of new job seeker candidates based on your needs. 

### Connect Us With Your Company

Do you love your job and wish you got to work with more Turing alumni? Is your company hiring devs or do they offer a referral program?

Share this flyer with your hiring manager, supervisor, or anyone in your network who needs to hire a dev and let them know that you’re a Turing School graduate. If you find someone who has questions or needs more information, you can make an email introduction to our Partnership Manager and they can take the conversation from there.

## Mentoring

We welcome alumni to give back to the Turing community as mentors for current students! Our mentorship program is integrated into our student community Houses. Depending on when you graduated, you may not be familiar yet with Houses - please read here for more information!

Each House has a group of mentors assigned to it to support students through regular office hours and 1:1s available to anyone in the House as well as by answering questions in the House channel. Here are the specific expectations for mentors:
* Each mentor commits to mentoring for 2 consecutive 6-week innings
* Each mentor hosts 2 office hours per inning in coordination with fellow House mentors (2 total hours during each 6-week period)
* Each mentor provides time for at least 6 1:1 mentoring sessions using a calendar sign-up posted for students to use (6 total hours during each 6-week period)
* Each mentor responds to questions posted in the House channels during specific “on-call” times coordinated with other in-program mentors, i.e., splitting up days/weeks to check the channel for questions from students (1-2 total hours during each 6-week period)

Within this structure, the goals for mentorship are to support students with:
* Asking for help in the workplace by first practicing it in a lower stakes environment
* Building a professional network to support them in their technical learning and job search readiness
* Navigating remote communities

When assigning mentors to Houses, we look for an equitable split of mentors who can support Back End and Front End learning. We also take into consideration demographic and identity-based characteristics of mentors in order to create a diverse and inclusive environment.

Mentors are also provided with ongoing support through collaboration with their fellow House mentors and training and resources from our mentor committee. Overall, mentoring can be an effective way to level up your own skills and develop new communicating and leadership skills to add to your career!
